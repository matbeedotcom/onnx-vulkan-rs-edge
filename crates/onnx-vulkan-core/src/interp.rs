//! Interpreter for the fused subgraph: **device-resident** execution.
//!
//! Intermediate tensors live in VRAM (`GpuBuffer`): inputs at fused node
//! boundaries are uploaded once, each internal node enqueues dispatches into the
//! `vk-compute` stream (no submit), and only boundary outputs execute
//! download — so an entire fused block costs **1 upload / 1 submit / 1
//! download** instead of per-node sync.
//!
//! Incremental op coverage: [`is_implemented`] lists ops the interpreter
//! can execute; `ep.rs` fuses **only** those (rest stays on CPU EP), so
//! transcription is verifiable as coverage grows. As coverage grows,
//! fused blocks merge and boundaries drop toward ~1.
